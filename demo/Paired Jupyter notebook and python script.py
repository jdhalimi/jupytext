# This is a notebook that you can use to experiment with the jupytext package.
#
# Proposed experimentations are
# 1. Open this Jupyter notebook (extension .ipynb) in Jupyter
# 2. Open the corresponding '.py' file. That is, copy the url for the notebook, that looks like
# ```
# https://hub.mybinder.org/user/mwouts-jupytext-g7315gce/notebooks/demo/Sample%20notebook%20with%20python%20representation.ipynb
# ```
# replace `/notebooks/` with `/edit/`, and change the extension from `ipynb` to `py`, to get an url like
# ```
# https://hub.mybinder.org/user/mwouts-jupytext-g7315gce/edit/demo/Sample%20notebook%20with%20python%20representation.py
# ```
# 3. Modify the notebook in Jupyter. Save. Refresh the python file in the editor, and observe the changes.
# 4. Now, modify the python file, save, and refresh the Jupyter notebook. Observe how inputs were updated, outputs preserved when possible, and kernel was left unchanged.
# 5. Browse the github repo using Jupyter in binder, and open arbitrary python files as notebooks. Run them when applicable.
